tpope breaks that?


general
    move to zsh
    learn md
    figure out LS_COLORS
    add pathogen
        and other tpope
        test install everything with tpope
    work on readme
        make readme link to files
        file name separation, and file descriptions should be smaller

bash
    ssh add before git push
    get aliases from oh my zsh

home
    best place for home git
    make sure profile/rc are split correctly
        nothing in profile except getting exports and alias files
        and maybe files for env, functions

    separate environments
        the 'master' should have universal stuff
        env specific aliases
            config file that specifies 'name' for different envs?
            then on runtime imports a different file based on that name

        (also vim env thingy, dracula stuff)

figure out best editor
    universal
    c/c++
    html/xml
    python
    javascript
    bash
    txt
    word?
    tex?
    markdown
        also learn markdown

vim
    move to next method
    camelCase and snake_case (small w) words 
        leader w
        leader W
    surround highlighted with brackets/paren/quotes
        cib like ci"
            finds next (only if not in)?
        ## use tpope/surround
    use previous indent level for new indent (o/O), maybe not for O
    insert mode backspace deleting 4 spaces?
    joining
        g<c-j> vs gJ
        

    see folding near numbers
    persistent marks and folding
    enable certain key combos 
        (<c-cr> vs j, <c-i> vs <tab>)
    insert line break
        <s-cr> and <s-c-cr> to break line up/down
        nah, just use i<cr>
    commenting
        language dependant 
        gc or <c-/> 
        ## tpope/commentary

    split a macro line into separate operations
    change order of parameters
        goes to comma
        last comma in line?
            change from next comma until the comma afterwards?
        a, b -> b, a 
        a, b, c -> a, c, b
a, b, c
(a, b, c)
b, , c

f,
b

$F,"xdBW"zdiw"xP;"zP
